# Work Day Scheduler

## This project is focused on providing an interactive scheduling tool that highlights past, present, and future timeslots with different colors based on the user's computer time. Utilizing moment.js and css, the Workday Scheduler allows users to input values into the schedule's textboxes and save those values into the browser's localStorage.
